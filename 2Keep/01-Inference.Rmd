### Inference {#Inference}

Consider the following SVAR model:
\[y_t = \Phi_1 y_{t-1} + \dots + \Phi_p y_{t-p} + \varepsilon_t\]
with $\varepsilon_t=B\eta_t$, $\Omega_\varepsilon=BB'$.

The corresponding infinite MA representation (Eq. \@ref(eq:InfMA), or Wold theorem, Theorem \@ref(thm:Wold)) is:
$$
y_t = \sum_{h=0}^\infty\Psi_h \eta_{t-h},
$$
where $\Psi_0=B$ and for $h=1,2,\dots$:
$$
\Psi_h = \sum_{j=1}^h\Psi_{h-j}\Phi_j,
$$
with $\Phi_j=0$ for $j>p$ (see Prop. \@ref(prp:computPsi) for this recursive computation of the $\Psi_j$'s).

Inference on the VAR coefficients $\{\Phi_j\}_{j=1,...,p}$ is straightforward (standard OLS inference). But inference is more complicated regarding IRF. Indeed, as shown by the previous equation, the (infinite) MA coefficients $\{\Psi_j\}_{j=1,...}$ are non-linear functions of the $\{\Phi_j\}_{j=1,...,p}$ and of $\Omega_\varepsilon$. An other issue pertain to small sample bias: typically, for persistent process, auto-regressive parameters are known to be downward biased.

The main inference methods are the following:

* Monte Carlo method (@Hamilton_1994)
* Asymptotic normal approximation (@Lutkepohl_1990), or Delta method
* Bootstrap method (Kilian_1998)



**Monte Carlo method**

We use Monte Carlo when we need to approximate the distribution of a variable whose distribution is unknown (here: the $\Psi_j$'s) but which is a function of another variable whose distribution is known (here, the $\Phi_j$'s).

For instance, suppose we know the distribution of a random variable $X$, which takes values in $\mathbb{R}$, with density function $p$. Assume we want to compute the mean of $\varphi(X)$. We have:
$$
\mathbb{E}(\varphi(X))=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\varphi(x)p(x)dx
$$
Suppose that the above integral does not have a simple expression. We cannot compute $\mathbb{E}(\varphi(X))$ but, by virtue of the law of large numbers (Theorem \@ref(LLNappendix)), we can approximate it as follows:
$$
\mathbb{E}(\varphi(X))\approx\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\varphi(X^{(i)}),
$$
where $\{X^{(i)}\}_{i=1,...,N}$ are $N$ independent draws of $X$. More generally, the distribution of $\varphi(X)$ can be approximated by the empirical distribution of the $\varphi(X^{(i)}$'s. Typically, if 10'000 values of $\varphi(X^{(i)}$ are drawn, the $5^{th}$ percentile of the p.d.f. of $\varphi(X)$ can be approximated by the $500^{th}$ value of the 10'000 draws of $\varphi(X^{(i)}$ (after arranging these values in ascending order).

As regards the computation of confidence intervals around IRFs, one has to think of $\{\widehat{\Phi}_j\}_{j=1,...,p}$, and of $\widehat{\Omega}$ as $X$ and $\{\widehat{\Psi}_j\}_{j=1,...}$ as $\varphi(X)$. (Proposition \@ref(prp:OLSVAR2) provides us with the asymptotic distribution of the "$X$.")

To summarize, here are the steps one can implement to derive confidence intervals for the IRFs using the Monte-Carlo approach:

For each iteration $k$:

1. Draw $\{\widehat{\Phi}_j^{(k)}\}_{j=1,...,p}$ and $\widehat{\Omega}^{(k)}$ from their asymptotic distribution (using Proposition \@ref(prp:OLSVAR2)).
2. Compute the matrix $B^{(k)}$ so that $\widehat{\Omega}^{(k)}=B^{(k)}B^{(k)'}$, according to your identification strategy.
4. Compute the associated IRFs $\{\widehat{\Psi}_j\}^{(k)}$.

Perform $N$ replications and report the median impulse response (and its confidence intervals).



**Delta method**

Suppose $\beta$ is a vector of parameters and $\beta$ is an estimator such that
$$
\sqrt{T}(\hat\beta-\beta)\overset{d}{\rightarrow}\mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma_\beta),
$$
where $d$ denotes convergence in distribution, $N(0,\Sigma_\beta)$ denotes the multivariate normal distribution with mean vector 0 and covariance matrix $\Sigma_\beta$ and $T$ is the sample size used for estimation.

Let $g(\beta) = (g_l(\beta),..., g_m(\beta))'$ be a continuously differentiable function with values in $\mathbb{R}^m$, and assume that $\partial g_i/\partial
\beta' = (\partial g_i/\partial \beta_j)$ is nonzero at $\beta$ for $i = 1,\dots, m$. Then
$$
\sqrt{T}(\color{blue}{g}(\hat\beta)-\color{blue}{g}(\beta))\overset{d}{\rightarrow}\mathcal{N}\left(0,\color{blue}{\frac{\partial g}{\partial \beta'}}\Sigma_\beta\color{blue}{\frac{\partial g'}{\partial \beta}}\right).
$$
(This formula underlies the Delta method, see Eq. \@ref(eq:DeltaMethod).)

Using this property, @Lutkepohl_1990 provides the asymptotic distributions of the $\Psi_j$'s.

A limit of the last two approaches (Monte Carlo and the Delta method) is that they critically rely on asymptotic results. Boostrapping approaches are more robust in small-sample situations.


**Bootstrap**

IRFs' confidence intervals are intervals where 90\% (or 95\%,75\%,...) of the IRFs would lie, if we were to repeat the estimation a large number of times in similar conditions ($T$ observations). We obviously cannot do this, because we have only one sample: $\{y_t\}_{t=1,..,T}$. But we can try to *construct* such samples.

Bootstrapping consists in:

* re-sampling $N$ times, i.e., constructing $N$ samples of $T$ observations, using the estimated
VAR coefficients and

    a. a sample of residuals from the distribution $N(0,BB')$ (**parametric approach**), or
    b. a sample of residuals drawn randomly from the set of the actual estimated residuals $\{\hat\varepsilon_t\}_{t=1,..,T}$. (**non-parametric approach**).

* re-estimating the SVAR $N$ times.

Here is the algorithm:

1. Construct a sample
$$
y_t^{(k)}=\widehat{\Phi}_1 y_{t-1}^{(k)} + \dots + \widehat{\Phi}_p y_{t-p}^{(k)} + \hat\varepsilon_t^{(k)},
$$
with $\hat\varepsilon_{t}^{(k)}=\hat\varepsilon_{s_t^{(k)}}$, where $\{s_1^{(k)},..,s_T^{(k)}\}$ is a random set from $\{1,..,T\}^T$.
2. Re-estimate the SVAR and compute the IRFs $\{\widehat{\Psi}_j\}^{(k)}$.

Perform $N$ replications and report the median impulse response (and its confidence intervals).

**Bootstrap-after-bootstrap** (@Kilian_1998)

The previous simple bootstrapping procedure deals with non-normality and small sample distribution, since we use the actual residuals. However, it does not deal with the *small sample bias*, stemming, in particular, from small-sample bias associated with OLS coefficient estimates $\{\widehat{\Phi}_j\}_{j=1,..,p}$. The main idea of the bootstrap-after-bootstrap of @Kilian_1998 is to run two consecutive boostraps: the objective of the first is to compute the bias, which can further be used to correct the initial estimates of the $\Phi_i$'s. Further, these corrected estimates are used ---in the second boostrap--- to compute a set of IRFs (as in the standard boostrap).

More formally, the algorithm is as follows:

1. Estimate the SVAR coefficients $\{\widehat{\Phi}_j\}_{j=1,..,p}$ and $\widehat{\Omega}$
2. **First bootstrap.** For each iteration $k$:
    a. Construct a sample
$$
y_t^{(k)}=\widehat{\Phi}_1 y_{t-1}^{(k)} + \dots + \widehat{\Phi}_p y_{t-p}^{(k)} + \hat\varepsilon_t^{(k)},
$$
with $\hat\varepsilon_{t}^{(k)}=\hat\varepsilon_{s_t^{(k)}}$, where $\{s_1^{(k)},..,s_T^{(k)}\}$ is a random set from $\{1,..,T\}^T$.
    b. Re-estimate the VAR and compute the coefficients $\{\widehat{\Phi}_j\}_{j=1,..,p}^{(k)}$.

3. Perform $N$ replications and compute the median coefficients $\{\widehat{\Phi}_j\}_{j=1,..,p}^*$. 
4. Approximate the bias terms by $\widehat{\Theta}_j=\widehat{\Phi}_j^*-\widehat{\Phi}_j$.
5. Construct the bias-corrected terms $\widetilde{\Phi}_j=\widehat{\Phi}_j-\widehat{\Theta}_j$.
6. **Second bootstrap.** For each iteration $k$:
    a. Construct a sample now from 
    $$y_t^{(k)}=\widetilde{\Phi}_1 y_{t-1}^{(k)} + \dots + \widetilde{\Phi}_p y_{t-p}^{(k)} + \hat\varepsilon_t^{(k)}.
    $$
    b. Re-estimate the VAR and compute the coefficients $\{\widehat{\Phi}^*_j\}_{j=1,..,p}^{(k)}$.
    c. Construct the bias-corrected estimates $\widetilde{\Phi}_j^{*(k)}=\widehat{\Phi}_j^{*(k)}-\widehat{\Theta}_j$.
    d. Compute the associated IRFs $\{\widetilde{\Psi}_j^{*(k)}\}_{j\ge 1}$.

7. Perform $N$ replications and compute the median and the confidence interval of the set of IRFs.

It should be noted that correcting for the bias can generate non-stationary results ($\tilde \Phi$ with eigenvalue with modulus $>1$). Solution (@Kilian_1998):

In step 5, check if the largest eigenvalue of $\tilde\Phi$ is of modulus <1.
If not, shrink the bias: for all $j$s, set $\widehat{\Theta}_j^{(i+1)}=\delta_{i+1}\widehat{\Theta}_j^{(i)}$, with $\delta_{i+1}=\delta_i-0.01$, starting with $\delta_1=1$ and $\widehat{\Theta}_j^{(1)} =\widehat{\Theta}_j$, and compute $\widetilde{\Phi}_j^{(i+1)}=\widehat{\Phi}_j-\widehat{\Theta}_j^{(i+1)}$ until the largest eigenvalue of $\tilde\Phi^{(i+1)}$ has modulus <1.

Function `VAR.Boot` of package `VAR.etp` (@VARetp) can be used to operate the bias-correction approach of @Kilian_1998:

```{r VARBoot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(VAR.etp)
library(vars) #standard VAR models
data(dat) # part of VAR.etp package
corrected <- VAR.Boot(dat,p=2,nb=200,type="const")
noncorrec <- VAR(dat,p=2)
rbind(corrected$coef[1,],
      (corrected$coef+corrected$Bias)[1,],
      noncorrec$varresult$inv$coefficients)
```
