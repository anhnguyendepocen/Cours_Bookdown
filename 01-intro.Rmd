# Before starting {#intro}

This course covers various econometric topics, including linear regression models, discrete-choice models, and time series analysis. It provides examples or simulations based on R codes.

The R codes use various packages that can be obtained from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org). Several pieces of code also involve procedures and data from my `AEC` package. The latter is available on GitHub. To install it, one need to employ the `devtools` library:

```{r installAEC, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("jrenne/AEC")
library(AEC)
```
