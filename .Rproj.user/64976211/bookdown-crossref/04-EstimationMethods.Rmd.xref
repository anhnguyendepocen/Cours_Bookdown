fig:MLE1 The red ticks, at the bottom, indicate observations (there are 200 of them). The historgram is based on these 200 observations
fig:MLE2 Proba. that $y_i-\\varepsilon \\le Y_i < y_i+\\varepsilon$, $i \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$. The vertical red line indicates the maximum of the function.
fig:MLE3 Log-likelihood function associated with the 200 i.i.d. observations. The vertical red line indicates the maximum of the function.
